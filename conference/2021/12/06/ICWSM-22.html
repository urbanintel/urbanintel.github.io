  <li>Important Dates: 3rd Full-paper Deadline: January 15, 2022 (by 23:59 PM Anywhere on Earth) (New submissions, and R&amp;Rs from Sep 2021 submissions) [Notifications: Mar 15, 2022]</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.icwsm.org/2022/index.html/index.html#guidelines">Guideliness</a></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="detailed-guidelines-for-paper-submission">Detailed Guidelines for Paper Submission</h1>
<h2 id="content-guidelines">Content Guidelines</h2>
<p>Format: Papers must be in high resolution PDF format, formatted for US Letter (8.5” x 11”) paper, using Type 1 or TrueType fonts. Full papers are recommended to be 8 pages and must be at most 11 pages long, including references and any appendix. Note that the page limit is increased to 11 for papers submitted to the January 2022 deadline. This year, the page limit for the submission is increased to 11 pages in order to give space for the new requirement of an Ethics Statement (see more below). We highly encourage the authors to keep the main content of the paper to 10 pages, and use extra space for ethics considerations only. Note that the camera-ready is still limited to 12 pages as in the past years. Revision papers and final camera-ready full papers can be up to 12 pages. Dataset papers must be no longer than 10 pages, Poster papers must be no longer than 4 pages, and Demo descriptions must be no longer than 2 pages, and all must be submitted by the deadlines given above, and formatted in AAAI two-column, camera-ready style (templates can be found at https://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit21.zip). No source files (Word or LaTeX) are required at the time of submission for review; only the PDF file is permitted. Finally, the copyright slug may be omitted in the initial submission phase and no copyright form is required until a paper is accepted for publication.</p>

<p>Anonymity: ICWSM-2022 review is double-blind. Therefore, please anonymize your submission: do not put the author(s) names or affiliation(s) at the start of the paper, and do not include funding or other acknowledgments in papers submitted for review. References to authors’ own prior relevant work should be included, but should not specify that this is the authors’ own work. Citations to the author’s own work should be anonymized, if possible, or can be added later to the final camera-ready version for publication. It is up to the authors’ discretion how much to further modify the body of the paper to preserve anonymity. The requirement for anonymity does not extend outside of the review process, e.g. the authors can decide how widely to distribute their papers over the Internet before the program committee meeting. Even in cases where the author’s identity is known to a reviewer, the double-blind process will serve as a symbolic reminder of the importance of evaluating the submitted work on its own merits without regard to authors’ reputation. Note that 2-page demo submissions and the dataset paper submissions, and only these, are exempt from the anonymization requirement as they often contain system URLs or URLs to data sharing services.</p>

<p>Language: All submissions must be in English.</p>

<p>Revisions: Papers that were previously submitted to ICWSM and received a “Revise and Resubmit “ decision should be accompanied by a copy of the previous reviews and an author response statement. The response statement may be in any format, but many reviewers appreciate a response that begins with an overall summary and then includes a table, with each row containing a reviewer comment in the left cell, and author’s response in the right cell. The response cell may explain why no changes were made, or may describe changes and direct the reviewer to a particular page, section, or figure, where the revised content appears. At the discretion of the Senior PC member handling the paper, the revised version may be sent back to some or all of the original reviewers for comment and evaluation, and may also be sent to additional reviewers.</p>

<p>Broader perspective, ethics and competing interests: In order to provide a balanced perspective, authors are required to include a statement about the potential broader impact of their work and ethical considerations. This statement needs to, at the bare minimum, be presented in a clearly marked paragraph/subsection/section in your paper. Authors should take care to discuss both positive and negative outcomes. Authors are also expected to describe steps taken to prevent or mitigate potential negative outcomes. For full papers that have collected new datasets and for dataset papers, discuss ethical considerations in the data collection process, and considerations around its release, and both potentially positive and negative outcomes of its use by others.</p>

<p>Authors are required to provide an explicit disclosure of funding (financial activities supporting the submitted work) and competing interests (related financial activities outside the submitted work) that could result in conflicts of interest. This section should be added to the camera-ready version of accepted papers and not for submission. Furthermore, authors are required to read the AAAI code of conduct and ethics guidelines and (i.) confirm that they abide by these rules and (ii.) discuss any concerns particularly relevant to their paper. Given a community as diverse as ICWSM, the issues related to ethics are likely to vary significantly across submissions. As such, we rely on you, the authors, to determine and cover the aspects most relevant to your work in your submission. Several checklists used in the past [1,2,3] can provide further guidance to scholars looking for starting points.</p>

<p>Resubmission: Authors will need to declare if a previous version of their submission was rejected at any peer-reviewed venue, and, if so, summarize the changes made in the current version and include the original review. Authors of rejected papers from ICWSM may revise and submit their revised papers after 6 months of the date of the last decision, but not before. For example, papers submitted in the Jan round can be resubmitted to the September round (6 months after the decision in March) but not the May round. This decision was made to avoid paper rejections due to lack of time for revisions and to discourage authors from submitting papers that are not ready.</p>

<p>Optional publication for social sciences and sociophysics papers
Researchers who wish to submit full papers without publication in the conference proceedings, may designate their submission as ‘social sciences and sociophysics (not for publication)’. Submissions must adhere to the formatting and content guidelines above. They will be reviewed according to the same process and criteria as all other full paper submissions. While we will not accept previously published papers, papers submitted as social sciences and sociophysics (not for publication) may be under review concurrently at a journal. Papers accepted to this track will be full presentations, integrated with the conference, but will be published only as abstracts in the ICWSM conference proceedings.</p>

<p>Submissions originally designated as not for publication cannot be converted at the end to publication in the ICWSM conference proceedings, because that would provide a mechanism enabling simultaneous consideration of the same paper for publication in two venues. Researchers who do wish to publish their papers in the ICWSM proceedings should submit to the regular track. All submitted papers, whether targeted for publication or not, will be judged according to the same acceptance criteria.</p>

<h2 id="duplicate-submissions">Duplicate Submissions</h2>
<p>ICWSM-2022 will not accept any paper that, at the time of submission, is under review for or has already been published or accepted for publication in a journal or conference. This restriction does not apply to submissions for non-archival workshops.</p>

<p>While we will not accept previously published papers, papers submitted as social sciences and sociophysics (not for publication) may be under review concurrently at a journal.</p>

<p>If duplicate submissions are identified during the review process then:</p>

<p>All submissions from that author will be disqualified from the current ICWSM conference;
And authors will not be permitted to submit papers to the ICWSM conference in the following year.</p>

<h2 id="conference-registration">Conference Registration</h2>
<p>Authors will be contacted about how to register for the conference. General registration for this year’s virtual conference will open soon. Stay tuned!</p>

<h2 id="publication">Publication</h2>
<p>All accepted papers and extended abstracts will be published in the conference proceedings, except for those submitted to the ‘social sciences and sociophysics (not for publication)’; only abstracts will be published for those. Though initial submissions of full papers must not exceed 11 pages, full papers accepted for publication will be allocated up to twelve (12) pages in the conference proceedings to facilitate to address comments raised by the reviewers. Authors will be required to transfer copyright to AAAI.</p>

<h2 id="datasets">Datasets</h2>
<p>ICWSM provides a service for hosting datasets pertaining to research presented at the conference. Authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to share the datasets on which their papers are based, while adhering to the terms and conditions of the data provider. Of these datasets, one will be selected for an award which will be based on the quality, scope, and timeliness of each dataset. More information will be available on our website.</p>
