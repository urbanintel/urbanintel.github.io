For time series prediction, some of the baseline algorithms you can test is ARIMA and VAR. Both are rather basic level of time series prediction models, and used for applications such as stock or traffic prediction.

# ARIMA

Autoregressive integrated moving average ([ARIMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average)) is 


$$ X_t - \alpha_1 X_{t-1} - ... - \alpha_{p'}X_{t-p'} = \epsilon_t + \theta_1 \epsilon_{t-1} + ... + \theta_q \epsilon_{t-q} $$

# VAR

Vector autoregression ([VAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_autoregression))

$$ y_t = c + A_1 y_{t-1} + A_2 y_{t-2} + ... + A_p y_{t-p} + e_t $$

while the $$ y_t \in \mathbb{R}^k $$ which is a $$k$$-dimensional vector.
