<p>The data collected by regular alight tags are not only used for public transportation policy establishment such as demand-tailored route reorganization based on big data, but also to provide citizens with various information necessary for daily life, such as bus congestion levels and the number of people getting on and off at each stop. However, the researches for bus demand prediction is limited, as they simply use geographical neighborhood or line connection network in the modeling, while ignoring the social meaning of the purpose of the destination. If we are able to reason why people are congested in specific time zone, it gives more explaination about the cause of the congestion and further can be used for prediction in the future. Here are some of the related works that has been already been done in this field:</p>
