<p>Traffic prediction is one of the most interesting topics in recent AI conferences. Traffic prediction is challenging yet intriguing due to its temporal and spatial complexities. Since traffic values such as traffic volume or speed are measured in real numbers, it is rather easier to define a problem as follows:</p>

\[[X^{(1)}, ..., X^{(t-1)};\mathcal{G}] \xrightarrow{h(\cdot)} \hat{X}^{(t)}\]

<p>Where \(X^{(t)} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_x}\) is a vector of traffic values of \(N_x\) sensors at timestamp \(t\), \(\mathcal{G}\) is a connection network between the traffic sensors, and \(h(\cdot)\) is a prediction model that can be assumed as a function. We normally evaluate the performance of the preiction model \(h(\cdot)\) using <em>mean absolute error (MAE)</em>, <em>mean squared error (MSE)</em>, <em>root mean squared error (RMSE)</em>, <em>mean absolute percent error (MAPE)</em>,  or <em>normalized mean absolute error (NMAE)</em>. These evaluation metrics may also be used as loss function if the model is based on deep neural network.</p>

<p>Although we first described the problem as we can use all the historical values to predict the next step, it is not feasible to require all the historical data for each next step prediction. Therefore, we may define a problem in rather narrowed down fashion as follows:</p>

\[[X^{(t-P+1)}, ..., X^{(t)};\mathcal{G}] \xrightarrow{h(\cdot)} [\hat{X}^{(t+1)}, ..., \hat{X}^{(t+Q)}]\]

<p>Here we defined problem to predict next \(Q\) time stemps based on previous \(P\) time steps. This assumes that the temporal correlation pattern can be found within \(P\)- timesteps to predict the next \(Q\)- timesteps while the spatial correlation between the traffic sensors catched by the sensor network \(\mathcal{G}\).</p>
